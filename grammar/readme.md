Here's a sample `README.md` for your Flask quiz application:

```markdown
# Flask Quiz Application

This is a Flask-based quiz application that allows users to test their knowledge of parts of speech. The application provides randomly generated sentences and asks users to identify the correct part of speech for selected words. The results are stored in a SQLite database, and users can view their recent scores or export them to a CSV file.

## Features

- **Random Sentence Generation**: The application generates random sentences from the NLTK Gutenberg corpus.
- **Part of Speech Identification**: Users are presented with a word from the sentence and must identify its part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
- **Scoring System**: The application calculates the user's score based on their answers and stores the results in a SQLite database.
- **Recent Scores**: Users can view their 10 most recent scores.
- **CSV Export**: Users can export their recent scores to a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- NLTK
- SQLite

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-quiz-app.git
   cd flask-quiz-app
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download NLTK data**:

   The application uses the Gutenberg corpus and other resources from NLTK. Download these resources by running:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('gutenberg')
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
   ```

5. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the application**:

   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` to start using the quiz application.

## Usage

1. **Start a Quiz**:
   - Go to the "Start Quiz" page, enter your name, and select the number of questions.
   - The application will present you with random sentences and a word to identify the part of speech.
   - After submitting, your score will be calculated, and the correct answers will be shown if your choices were incorrect.

2. **View Recent Scores**:
   - Navigate to the "Recent Scores" page to view your 10 most recent quiz results.

3. **Export Scores**:
   - You can export your recent scores to a CSV file by clicking the "Export to CSV" button on the "Recent Scores" page.
